# What Minimalism Taught Me About Writing Better Code

Minimalism isnâ€™t about having less â€” itâ€™s about having **only what matters**.

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve tried to apply this to my personal coding projects. The result? Less stress, fewer bugs, and a deeper understanding of the tools I use.

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned.

---

## 1. ðŸ”§ Use fewer dependencies

I used to install libraries for everything:
- date formatting? `moment`
- animations? `framer-motion`
- fetching? `axios`

Now I ask: **can the platform do it natively?**  
If yes, I skip the library.

Built-in `fetch`, `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, and CSS transitions are surprisingly powerful.

## 2. ðŸ§¼ Clean design = clear intent

I simplified my UI:
- fewer buttons
- one call to action per screen
- use of whitespace

Turns out, this helps the **user** *and* the **developer**.  
Less logic to manage = fewer bugs.

## 3. ðŸ“¦ Structure like a craftsman

I started:
- Writing small functions
- Grouping by feature not type
- Using folders like `features/blog/` instead of `components/`, `pages/`, `utils/`

It feels like Iâ€™m building something with care â€” not just hacking something together.

---

## ðŸ§˜ Final Takeaway

Minimalism in code isn't about writing less. It's about writing **only whatâ€™s needed** â€” no more, no less.

I now value:
- Simplicity over cleverness
- Defaults over customization
- Constraints over chaos

Try it in your next project. Youâ€™ll feel lighter.
