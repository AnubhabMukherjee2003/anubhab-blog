# Why I Started Blogging as a Developer

I used to think blogging was for tech influencers and indie hackers trying to sell something.

But over time, I realized a blog could be more — it could be a **place to think out loud**, keep a digital trail of my learning, and most importantly, build clarity for myself.

## 🧠 Learning in Public

There’s something magical about writing your thoughts for someone else to read. It forces you to go from “I think I get it” to “I understand it deeply enough to explain.”

When I tried to write a blog about JavaScript closures, I suddenly noticed the tiny things I had ignored — lexical environments, garbage collection, hoisting. These gaps only appeared when I *wrote*.

That’s when I understood the phrase:  
> “Writing is thinking.”

## ✍️ My Writing Stack

I'm using **Next.js** with **MDX**, and it's been a joy. I can write Markdown and embed components as needed. No CMS, no DB — just a Git-based content repo.

I like to keep it simple:
- Blog posts in `/markdown`
- Rendered via static pages
- Tailwind for styling
- Hosted on Vercel

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Even if no one reads your blog, you still win.  
You gain:
- Clarity
- A portfolio of ideas
- A searchable knowledge base

I wish I started earlier. But I’m glad I started now.
