# My Honest Thoughts on AI and Creativity

Everyone’s talking about AI — some are excited, some are scared. I’m a mix of both.

We’re watching something profound unfold. And I wanted to take a moment to pause and think about **what this means for creators** like me.

## 🤖 When AI Writes Code

Copilot changed how I write JavaScript. It’s not perfect, but it’s fast, and more often than not, it helps me write **90% working code** that I then tweak.

Is that cheating? I don’t think so.  
It’s like a pair programmer who never gets tired.

What matters is still the same:
- Understanding the **problem**
- Designing the **solution**
- Reviewing the **code quality**

## 🎨 When AI Makes Art

There’s something different about DALL·E, Midjourney, and GPT writing poetry.  
Are these tools just remixing?  
Or are they creating?

I think the answer is both.

And the more important question is:
> “How do *we* evolve when tools evolve?”

## 🧭 Where I Stand

AI is not coming for *creatives* — it’s coming **for repetitive**.  
If your creativity is just “repeating what you saw,” AI can already do that. But if your creativity is synthesis, insight, perspective — you’re safe.

For now.

## 📌 So... What Now?

I’m learning to **collaborate** with AI.  
Like I use Git, VSCode, Tailwind, etc. — I now use AI tools to explore ideas, get unstuck, and write faster.

But I still hit “Publish.”

The final word should be human.
